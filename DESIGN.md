# Archive Ribbon — Design Direction

Archive Ribbon is a museum reading room: quiet paper, one era color, archive
labels, and a physical-looking thread of objects. The timeline is a horizontal
catalog rail on desktop and a vertical label stack on narrow screens.

The object card is the main reading surface. It keeps context and the
synthetic-record boundary visible instead of presenting a generic timeline
dashboard.

## Storybook

Storybook 10 (`@storybook/nextjs-vite`) shows this design system with the app's real CSS, tokens and fonts.

```bash
npm run storybook        # http://localhost:6006
npm run build-storybook  # static build in storybook-static/ (CI: .github/workflows/storybook.yml)
```

- **Foundations/Tokens** reads every CSS custom property the app defines at runtime, so it never drifts from the code.
- **Design/DESIGN.md** renders this file.
- **Components/**, **Sections/** and **Pages/** show the UI with mock data only (no network, analytics off).
- Toolbar: locale, theme (light / dark, when the app has a dark theme), viewports 320 / 375 / 768 / 1440. The a11y panel runs axe (WCAG 2.2 AA).
- Rule: a new shared component or page section ships with a story in `stories/`.
